Allora Network Testnet: AI Prediction Node


Allora Network is a decentralized AI network built as a Layer 1 blockchain on the Cosmos stack. Alloraâ€™s decentralized AI network enhances machine intelligence with context-aware inference synthesis and modular topics, ensuring superior accuracy and continual improvement. Participants earn ALLO tokens for their contributions, promoting high-quality insights and economic security. Open and transparent, Allora democratizes advanced AI for diverse applications in finance, healthcare, and more, while maintaining strict data privacy and security. Experience the future of evolving AI with Allora.

In the Allora network, the topic coordinator sets the rules and goals for each AI task. Workers generate inferences and forecast the performance of other workers' inferences. Reputers evaluate these inferences against the ground truth and provide feedback. This collaboration ensures that the network continually improves its accuracy through context-aware adjustments and performance forecasting, leading to superior results.

==============================================

Allora network have several Phase. Each phase, Allora allowed public to participate on their project to run Worker Node. They use basic Coin prediction node where Ai is predicting each token prices.

On 5 March, 2024. Allora announce Edgenet phase : https://x.com/AlloraNetwork/status/1765021473776046153
